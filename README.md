#### Part 1
The first problem is to implement Linear Regression using Gradient Descent from scratch. The dataset used is Boston Housing Price dataset. The features given include details about houses like number of rooms, per capita price in the town and so on. The train-test split is done as 70%-30%. To find the error in the predictions, Root mean squared error is implemented.
#### Part 2 
The second part is a classic binary classification problem. 
The first step is to generate random points to be classified. After generating those, we keep changing the values of X,Y and slope of line which clasifies the points into 2 classes.
